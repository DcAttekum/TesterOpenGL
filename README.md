# TesterOpenGL
This is a testing app for myself to learn opengl in c++. This is not meant to be a good or functioning program and is just something for myself to play about with. There might be coding practices or ways of doing stuff in here which is really not up to standard. But with this project I can at least have the freedom to do that without any repercussions.
